After a detailed study of the virus and its life cycle, he proposes a theory: Initially, a host cell is co-infected with 2 viruses from the same virus family. Within the host cell, concomitant production of various genome segments from both viruses occurs. Ultimately, the different genome segments from the viruses are packaged into a unique and novel virus particle. The newly formed virus particle is both stable and viable and is a new strain from the virus family that caused the outbreak of infection.

Examination shows concavity of the medial border of the left foot with a skin crease just below the ball of the great toe. The lateral border of the left foot is convex. The heel is in neutral position. Tickling the lateral border of the foot leads to correction of the deformity. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. X-ray of the left foot shows an increased angle between the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bones.

Further evaluation including biopsy confirms the diagnosis of intermediate-risk neuroblastoma. The physician recommends the established standard treatment, which is initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection, if possible. After a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of chemotherapy, the likelihood of unresectability without neoadjuvant treatment, and the prognosis without it, the patient's parents steadily refuse chemotherapy because they do not want their son to suffer the side effects.
