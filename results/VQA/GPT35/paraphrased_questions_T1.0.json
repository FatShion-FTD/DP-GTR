Based on this table, you can determine the net weight out compares to the net weight in, in percentage.\n\nTo determine the answer, you must calculate the net pounds difference between infeed and outfeed. Subtract value of the \"In Feed\" column from the \"Out Feed\" column. The net weight out is always higher than net weight in. So after calculation, you get the total pounds that you lost.
